        <h1>Bank robbery</h1>
        <p>Petty theft, theft and drug dealing alone won't get you far in Los Santos. To get rich, Michael, Franklin and
          Trevor will work together on robberies - large missions with multiple parts. The success of such assignments
          lies in careful preparation, selection of participants and impeccable execution. The main thing in GTA V is
          money. And although the game has enough ways to get and spend cash, you can only make a big fortune on
          robberies.</p>
